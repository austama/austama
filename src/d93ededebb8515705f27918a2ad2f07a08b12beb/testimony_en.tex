I have been weak, felt like fainting and got diagnosed with myocarditis
yesterday 3rd November.

I was forced to take the Vaccine for work.

I had the heart of an athlete and exercise everyday!

My blood pressure has never been high, but now my blood pressure is off the
charts!

I’m so angry! I did not want this! I tried everything not to get this Pfizer
Vaccine! I will never allow my children to get it.
