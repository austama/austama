On 1st October 2021 Joey, aged 35, accepted the Pfizer Vaccine and suffered a
massive heart attack hours after getting the injection. He stopped breathing and
passed out the following day. Joey fought hard to recover, but the damage was
already done, lack of oxygen to the brain caused his body to shut down.

The condition, which the vaccine is reported to cause, is known as myocarditis,
which inflames, enlarges, and weakens the heart muscle to the point of sudden
death.

Joey remained unconscious and on a ventilator for several days before doctors
pronounced him brain dead. In an effort to honor his wishes, Joey remained on a
ventilator while the hospital arranged to donate his organs; however, his heart
gave out a final time before they were able to do so.

Joey, didn’t want to get the vaccine but he also did not want to get fired from
his job for not getting it, so he went ahead.

He was a loving father and lived for his children, Joey and Mia ,12-year-old
fraternal twins.
